## Overview

Exhibit Art is a place for artists to show-case their work and a place for potential buyers to connect with the artists. You can view the deployed site [here](https://leithdm.github.io/milestone-project-3/).

<br/>

## UX

This project is part of the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development course, specifically **Module 3: Data Centric Development**. 

The objective for this milestone project is to "*build a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain*".

<br/>

### User Stories

- User Stories were written from the perspective of the user:
    - the registered artist.
    - the registered prospective buyer of art that wants to connect with the artist. 
    - the non-registered pubic that just wants to look at art. 
    - the site administrator.

"**__As an *artist*, I__** ______________________________________________"

- should be able to register an account with the site as an artist. 
- should be able to create an artist portfolio page, with relevant details. 
- should be able to CRUD my portfolio page. 
- should be able to CRUD items of art to my portfolio. 
- should be able to see how many views my art has received. 
- should be able to see how many likes my art has received. 
- should be notified if a buyer has shown interest in a particular piece of art.

"**__As a *buyer*, I__** ______________________________________________"

- should be able to create a buyer portfolio page, with basic details. 
- should be able to CRUD my portfolio page. 
- should be able to see what items of art I like.
- should be able to see what items of art I have viewed. 
- should be able to see what artists I have contacted. 
- should be presented with a gallery of art on the main page. 
- should be able to click on any item of art in the gallery to see more details. 
- should be able to search through the art based on art type. 
- should be able to click on a 'contact the artist' button and be presented with a contact form. 
- should be able to fill out the form in order to contact and interact further with the artist.

"**__As an *administrator*, I__** ______________________________________________"

- should have an adminstrator account setup. 
- should be able to see an administrator dashboard page. 
- should be able to see a list of all art items, with relevant details. 
- should be able to see a list of all artists, with relevant details. 
- should be able to edit the main page carousel in order to select whatever images I would like to display.

### Design


<br/>

#### Color Scheme

- ![#800080](https://placehold.it/15/800080/800080) purple text/background
- ![#B22234](https://placehold.it/15/B22234/B22234) red button
- ![#FFFF00](https://placehold.it/15/FFFF00/FFFF00) yellow button/text
- ![#00C0A3](https://placehold.it/15/00C0A3/00C0A3) green text
- ![#02AFFF](https://placehold.it/15/02AFFF/02AFFF) blue dashboard (score, level, lives)
- All of these colors are set at `:root` level within the [style.css](assets/css/style.css) file. The use of css custom properties (variables) is in keeping with the principles of DRY.


#### Icons

- [Font Awesome 5.6.1](https://fontawesome.com/) icons are used in the [how to play](how-to-play.html) page, and in the gamepad controller buttons.

<br/>

#### Typography

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used across the site, namely:
  - [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P) : game title and menu buttons.

<br/>

### Wireframes

- Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) and can be viewed by clicking on links below.

## Agile Project Management

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/features/project-management/) was used to iteratively sprint through the development of this app. Each *User Story* became an individual *Issue*, and was placed in a Kanban board composed of the following columns:
1. **Backlog** - all user stories, ordered by value/priority.
2. **Sprint** - a subset of user stories to be completed in a x1 week sprint.
3. **In Progress** - user stories currently being worked on from current sprint.
4. **Done** - user stories completed, and tested.

Along with tracking user stories, Github Projects was also used to track bugs. **The full list of user stories/bugs can be viewed [here](https://github.com/leithdm/milestone-project-3/projects/1).**
